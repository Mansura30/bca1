<P><I><BIG><BIG><BIG><FONT COLOR="GREY">Bioplastic bottles differ from conventional plastics in that the raw material of bioplastics is made from biobased material or that the material is compostable or both.<BR> The term “biobased” only says something about the origin of the material and nothing about the end-of-life.<BR> We use only bio-plastic (PLA) for our bottles.

<P><I><BIG><BIG><BIG><FONT COLOR="GREY">Bio-based plastics can help to reduce the dependency on limited fossil resources, which are expected to become significantly more expensive in the coming decades.<BR><BR> Bio-based plastics are made from renewable sources instead of oil and that way gradually substitute fossil resources used to produce plastics with renewable resources (currently predominantly annual crops, such as corn and sugar beet, or perennial cultures, such as cassava and sugar cane).
<BR><BR>Bio-based plastics also have the unique potential to reduce GHG emissions or even be carbon neutral. Plants absorb atmospheric carbon dioxide as they grow. Using plants (i.e. biomass) to produce bio-based plastics constitutes a temporary removal of greenhouse gases (CO2) from the atmosphere. This carbon fixation can be extended for a period of time by establishing ‘use cascades’, that means if the material is being reused or recycled as often as possible before being used for energy recovery.<BR></BR> In energy recovery, the previously sequestered CO2 is released and renewable energy is being produced
